# Stock-Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze stock data for my friend Steve, a newly graduated finance major. Steve's parents are passionate about green energy, and have decided to invest all of their money into DAQO New Energy Corp, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. I used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Microsoft Excel to analyze this stock's total daily volume and annual return. Next, I analyzed 11 additional green stocks to determine whether DAQO is their best option to invest in, based on these statistics. The purpose of using VBA was to create an efficient method for analyzing the data; the focus of this challenge was to restructure the code so it could be easily replicated for future analyses in a process known as refactoring.
